# Time-Series-Forecasting-LSTM
Time series forecasting of milk consumption with time using LSTM in Python was done using the Keras library using an LSTM model. The model was trained to predict the seasonal variations in milk consumption around the year. The result obtained was a very close approximation of the actual data.
